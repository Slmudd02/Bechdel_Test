## About

The Bechdel test was created to show how women are being pretrayed in a sexist way on film. In order to pass the test the films must contain three things:
 - Two lead female characters that the audience knows the name of 
 - Characters have to talk to each other
 - Must talk about something other than men

I have two datasets that I got from kaggle.com. The first are the top grossing movies of all time. The second are top grossing movies that passed or failed the Bechdel test. I mereged these two datasets together using python.

## How To Run This Program 

Create a vritual enviornment. 
In order to create a conda enviorment like I did you must have Anaconda installed on your computer. In the Anaconda prompt do the folowing code:
```python
conda --name venv_name python
```

Instead of "venv_name" put the name of the new virtual enviornment. Once it is created run the following code:
```python
conda install jupyter 
```
```
conda install pandas
```
conda install matplotlib
```
```
conda install numpy
```
