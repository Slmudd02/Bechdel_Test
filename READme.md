# Bechdel Test
### By Shala 

## About

The Bechdel test was created to show how women are pretrayed in a sexist way in film. In order to pass this test the film must contain three things:
    - Two lead female characters that the audience knows the name of 
    - They must speak to each other
    - Must talk about something other than men

I have two datasets that I got from kaggle.com. The first one is the top grossing movies of all time. The second are top grossing movies that passed or failed the Bechdel test. This is what I found out.
