## About

The Bechdel test was created to show how women are being pretrayed in a sexist way on film. In order to pass the test the films must contain three things:
 - Two lead female characters that the audience knows the name of 
 - Characters have to talk to each other
 - Must talk about something other than men

I have two datasets that I got from kaggle.com. The first are the top grossing movies of all time. The second are top grossing movies that passed or failed the Bechdel test. I mereged these two datasets together using python.
