## About

The Bechdel test was created to show the portrayal of women in a sexist way on film. In order to pass the test films must contain three things:
 - Two lead female characters that the audience knows the name of 
 - Characters have to talk to each other
 - Characters must talk about something other than men

I utilized two data sets that were retrieved from kaggle.com. The first are the top grossing movies of all time. The second are top grossing movies that passed or failed the Bechdel test. I merged both datasets together using python.

## Source 
Kaggle.com

## How To Run This Program 
First clone my repo.

Then, create a virtual environment. 
In order to create a conda environment like I did you must have Anaconda installed on your computer. Make sure you are in my cloned repo directory. In the Anaconda prompt do the following code:

```
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 ```

Open the Bechdel_test_project-checkpoint.ipynb file that's in my repo.

Once the file is opened activate the bechdel virtual environment.



## Code Louisville Requirements Met
- Feature 1:
    - Read two data files
- Feature 2:
    - Clean data and perform a pandas merge with two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.
- Feature 3:
    - Make 3 matplotlib visualizations to display data.
- Feature 4:
    - Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in the README on how the user should set one up
